# Scraper

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

### Organization

This node.js app uses a switch function to take a command line argument as a command, one of four options. The options allow the user to search for concerts, movies, and music using user-provided search terms.

### How-to operate

After cloning the repository, npm install to load all required third-party software. Following installation the user can initiate the program by entering "node liri.js " + (a command) + (a request).
The command can only be one of four: "spotify-this", "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", and "do-what-it-says". An inappropriate command will result in an error message.
The request should be pertinent to the command i.e. the name of a song, name of a band, or name of a movie.
Relevant results will then be console logged to display to the user.
